#### The Gist

Pin-tourist will be a MERN stack clone of [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com)...with a twist. This site will follow along the same operation as Pinterest, but with a focus on locations. Users will be able to discover new locations and save them to boards with custom categories. Users may also follow the travels of other users to gain inspiration and new travel ideas.

#### Background and Overview
Pin-tourist lets users curate their feed with images leading to articles 
Pinterest is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more.

Home feed is the center of Pinterest. It's where you'll find ideas, or Pins, with recommendations based on user's interests, as well as what people user follows on Pinterest are saving.


#### Features/Core Functionalities

* Pins
Pins are ideas that people on Pin-tourist find and save from around the web. Each Pin links back to the website it was saved from. If the user's clicks through the Pin, user can learn how to make it or where to buy it.

* Boards
The Pins users saves live on your boards. Users can name boards and arrange them on their profile however they want. They can invite other people on Pinterest to collaborate on their boards to find even more ideas.

* Sections
To organize the Pins within boards, users can create board sections. 

* Secret Boards
If the user prefers to keep their Pins private or their camping trip is actually a sneaky surprise, they can make their board secret. Only user and anyone they invite can see their secret boards.


* Profile
Users can find all the Pins they saves, boards they creates, along with who’s following them and everyone they’re following, including boards and topics, in their profile. Anyone can see their profile, but their secret boards will stay hidden.
