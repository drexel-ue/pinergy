#### Simple web scraper

```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

exports.scrape = async url => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch(); // Opens a lightweight Chromium instance.

  try {
    const page = await browser.newPage(); // Opens a new tab in that instance.

    await page.goto(url); // Navigates to the provided url.

    await page.waitForSelector("img", { visible: true }); // Waits for an <img> tag to be available.

    const data = await page.evaluate(() => {
      const images = document.querySelectorAll("img"); // Selects all <img> elements.
      let urls = [...images].map(image => image.src); // Map the src attributes to an array.
      if (urls.length > 10) urls = urls.slice(0, 10); // Limit array length to 10.
      return urls;
    });

    browser.close();

    return data.slice(1);
  } catch (e) {
    browser.close();
    return e.toString();
  }
};
